GHC's RISC-V Native Code Generation Backend
===========================================

This talk consists of three parts.

First, I will explain what's so exciting about RISC-V and why it's not just
"yet another architecture".

Second, we will take a look at the current state of RISC-V support in GHC with
a focus on the Native Code Generation Backend ("NCG.) Furthermore, future
improvements will be discussed (finally, we're at the dawn of Zurihac 2025 ;)
.)

Last (but not least), I'd like to share a couple of tricks and hints to future
NCG developers.
